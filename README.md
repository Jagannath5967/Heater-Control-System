# Heater-Control-System
This project implements a basic heater control system using a DS18B20 temperature sensor and a simulated heater (red LED). The system continuously monitors the temperature and switches between various states—IDLE, HEATING, STABILIZING, TARGET REACHED, and OVERHEAT—based on defined temperature thresholds.
